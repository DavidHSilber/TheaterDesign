Plot renders a theatrical lighting plot into a Scalable Vector Graphic (SVG)
drawing.

The lighting plot is described in an XML file.

The base element is called "plot" and currently has no attributes.

The "plot" element should have two children: a "venue" and an "event". Things built permenantly into the space should be specified within the venue element. Transient things specific to the event should be under event. This will make reuse of the venue information easier.

In creating a specific plot, it makes sense to start with the venue. When the venue is built around a stage ( in general
and in particular to build our plot around the stage. (This approach needs to
be modified when the stage is a temporary structure, but we'll get back to that
later.)

Here is a simple stage, 22 feet wide and 11 feet deep.
I'm specifying sizes in inches because it simplifies other processing.

<plot>
  <venue >
    <stage depth="132" width="264" />
  </venue>
</plot>

By default, the coordinate system of the venue has its origin at the top left
corner of the page - generally stage right. When the venue has a proscenium
stage, then the origin is under the center of the proscenium arch, with
measurements along the X-axis increasing as one goes towards stage left and
measurements along the Y-axis increasing in the direction of upstage. Vertical
measurements start at the stage surface, so in venues with stadium seating that
starts below the stage level, the audience (at least the front part) is at a
negative value for Z.

A boom with a single vertical pipe can be specified like so:

    <pipebase id="a76" x="-240" y="-240" z="-24" />
      <pipe id="v1" length="144" >
    </pipebase>

The base is placed at specified coordinates. In the case of a pipebase, I'm
presuming a standard 50-pound cast iron base, or at least something of
that approximate dimension, threaded in the center for a pipe. The pipe
contained within a base description is attached to that base.


TODO:
  - I shouldn't need to put an ID into a trussBase, but it will require generating
    IDs internally for bases that do not have an ID.
  - I shouldn't need to put an ID into a pipe, but it will require generating
    IDs internally for pipes that do not have an ID. (And then such pipes will
    not be able to be referenced.)





    <trussbase id="b2" x="240" y="-240" z="-24" />
      <truss id="v2" length="120" >
        <luminaire model="Source Four" lens="50" location="a 72" spin="135" />
      </truss>
    </trussbase>>

For a proscenium stage, 

<plot>
  <venue >
    <stage depth="322" width="780" >
      <proscenium width="483" height="212" depth="13" />
      <apron width="624" depth="144" />
    </stage>
  </venue>
</plot>
