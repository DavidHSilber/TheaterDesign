Back when I wrote this in Java, I needed to have a stage where some Elemental
types were verified after all the  constructors had run, so I made a Verifier
class which all of those Elementals could inherit from. Unfortunately, running
the verify loop on all of the Elements takes forever. (Well, a long time.)

If I make 'Verifier' into a trait rather than having all of the MinderDom
objects incorporate it, then only the types that need it will have it.

These are the remaining Java classes which make use of Verify, and so would have
to be converted to Scala:
  Chair.java 
  Cheeseborough.java 
  Device.java 
  Luminaire.java
  Zone.java 

Plus, of course: Verifier.java

As a bonus, I would be able to remove the bogus 'verify()' stub from everything
that doesn't actually use the Veritfier.
