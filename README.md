# TheaterDesign
Draw lighitng plots from XML descriptions.

Given an XML description of a theatrical venue, with its varioius installed and temporary equipment, draw lighting plots.

The drawing is generated in SVG.

'Theatrical venue' could be a theater with a proscenium stage and linesets, a black box with a fixed grid, or arbitrary spaces (e.g. convention center or hotel ballroom) with no inbuilt infrastructure.

Arbitrary lighting instruments can be defined in the XML.
